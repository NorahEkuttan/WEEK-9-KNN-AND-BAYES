# QUESTION 1 ON TITANIC DATASET
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).



# QUESTION 2 ON SPAM OR NOT SPAM

Relevant Information:
        The "spam" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web
        sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...
	Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and 
	individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam 
	e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence
	the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of 
	non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized 
	spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam 
	indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to 
	generate a general purpose spam filter.
